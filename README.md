Web-based code editor that allows multiple users to collaboratively edit code in real-time

You are tasked with creating a web-based code editor that allows multiple users to collaboratively edit code in real-time, with the specific requirement of hosting it locally. The application should support the following features:

Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users should be able to connect to the same code editor session simultaneously. Any changes made by one user should be immediately reflected on the screens of all other connected users in real-time, even when hosted on a local network.

User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization for local users. Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and join or create collaborative code editing sessions within the local network.

Code Syntax Highlighting: The code editor should support syntax highlighting for popular programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS).

Code Versioning: Implement a basic version control system that allows users to view the revision history, revert to previous versions, and leave comments on specific code changes.

Chat Integration: Include a chat feature within the application to allow users to communicate with each other while collaborating on code, all within the confines of a local network.

Error Handling: Handle synchronization conflicts gracefully, ensuring that if two users edit the same line of code simultaneously, it doesn't result in data corruption, even in a local hosting environment.

User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that is responsive and intuitive to use for local users.

Local Deployment: Deploy the application to a local server or network environment, such as a local intranet or a network-attached server. Provide detailed documentation on the local deployment process.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Choose a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js) and use WebSocket or a similar technology for real-time updates.

Backend: Use a server-side technology like Node.js or Django, and employ WebSockets or another suitable technology for real-time communication in a local network.

Database: Choose an appropriate database system (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storing user data and code revisions in a local context.

Version Control: Integrate a version control system like Git or implement a custom solution suitable for local hosting.

Chat: Implement the chat feature using WebSocket or a chat library for local users.

Local Deployment: Deploy the application to a local server or network environment.

Additional Considerations:

Ensure the codebase is well-structured, maintainable, and follows best practices for local hosting.

Write comprehensive documentation for both users and developers, specifically tailored to local deployment.

Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access within the local network environment.

Optimize the application for performance, especially concerning real-time updates in a local hosting context.

This project showcases your ability to create a locally hosted, full-stack, real-time collaborative code editor with various complex features, making it an impressive addition to a full-stack developer's resume.
